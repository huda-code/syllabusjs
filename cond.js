Control Flow – Loops (for, while)
Why next?
Students just learned how values change step-by-step.

Now they’re ready to repeat actions (looping), which connects naturally
Week Focus: Loops – for, while

// For loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hello " + i);
}

// While loop
let j = 1;
while (j <= 5) {
  console.log("Hi " + j);
  j++;
}

 Learning Goals:
Understand repetition using for and while

Learn loop structure: start → condition → update

Use loops with increment/decrement (review tied in)

Practice Ideas:
Print 1 to 10

Print even numbers

Count down from 10

Multiplication table using loop

Optional Add-On:
Introduce break and continue with fun examples:

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break;
  console.log(i); // stops at 4
}
