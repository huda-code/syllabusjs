Goal:
Help kids understand what the ternary operator is, why it’s useful, and how to use it in JavaScript.

Step-by-Step Teaching Plan
Ask: “If you're hungry, what do you do?”
 “Eat” if hungry, ❌ “Wait” if not hungry.

Use a sentence:
👉 "Are you hungry? If yes, eat; if no, wait."
Write this as a simple if/else:
if (isHungry) {
  action = "Eat";
} else {
  action = "Wait";
}

Then show this in ternary form:
const action = isHungry ? "Eat": "Wait";

Explain the Formula
Write it BIG and COLORFUL:
condition ? doThisIfTrue : doThisIfFalse

Break it down:
condition: something that’s true or false
?: means "if true"
:: means "if not"

Example:
const age = 10;
const canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes": "No";
Ask: “Can someone age 10 vote? No? Let’s try it!”


Make It Interactive
Have them guess outcomes:
const time = 9;
const greeting = time < 12 ? "Good morning": "Good afternoon";
Ask: “What will the greeting be if time is 9?”
Let kids answer before revealing output.

Step 4: Practice With Their World
Use familiar examples:
const isWeekend = true;
const plan = isWeekend ? "Play video games!" : "Do homework.";
console.log(plan);


 Introduce Template Literals
const items = 0;
console.log(`You have ${items > 0 ? items : "no"} items in your cart.`);
Show how it fills in the message nicely!

Quick Tip – Avoid Confusing Code
Don't write this at first:
score >= 90 ? "A" : score >= 80 ? "B" : "F"
Tell them: “Use ternary for quick decisions. For tricky stuff, we’ll use if/else.”

Assignment / Activity for Kids
🧩 "Ternary Quest!" – Mini Coding Challenge
Let kids try writing their own:

1. Favorite Color
const favColor = "blue";
const message = favColor === "blue" ? "Blue is cool!" : "Nice choice!";
console.log(message);

2. Cold Weather
const temp = 5;
const clothes = temp < 10 ? "Wear a jacket!" : "You're good.";
console.log(clothes);

Challenge Questions:
Let them fill in the blanks:
const hasPet = true;
// Message: If you have a pet → "You’re lucky!", else → "Pets are fun!"
const msg = ____________________________

const level = 6;
// If level > 5 → "Level up!", else → "Keep going!"
const result = __________________________

Have them write "If I were a superhero…" ternary statements:
const isFlying = true;
const power = isFlying ? "Sky is the limit!" : "Run super fast!";
